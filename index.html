        <p>Hello, my name is Matt Handy. I grew up in Orem, Utah. I married Alice Portillo, who is from Paraguay, in
            2002. We lived in Utah until 2018, at which point we moved to Paraguay. I have been a web programmer since
            2001, but never got a degree. I am excited to finally be working towards a bachelor's degree through
            Pathway and BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include playing guitar and trumpet, playing video games, and listening to Jazz and Bluegrass
            music. I love all animals and have two cats and two dogs.</p>
