        <p class="margins">Hello, my name is Matt Handy. I grew up in Orem, Utah. I married Alice Portillo,
            who is from Paraguay, in
            2002. We lived in Utah until 2018, at which point we moved to Paraguay. I have been a web programmer since
            2001, but never got a degree. I am excited to finally be working towards a bachelor's degree through
            Pathway and BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p class="margins">My hobbies include playing guitar and trumpet, playing video games, and listening
            to Jazz and Bluegrass
            music. I love all animals and have two cats and two dogs.</p>

        <p>Paraguay is a small country in the heart of South America, about the size of California and with a population
            of just over 7 million people. There are two official languages: Spanish and Guarani (a native american
            dialect).</p>
